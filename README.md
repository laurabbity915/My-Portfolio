# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

I would like to create my own portfolio web page with my Github link and my contacts.

When you click the navigations, should scroll down to the correct section.

And I put some projects I've done and when you click the picture at "Work" section, it will bring you to the Github of that project.

I put my contact at the bottom, feel free to contact:)
